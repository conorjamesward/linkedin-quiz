# Simple Quiz for LinkedIn Skill assessments

This is built off of the amazing work from the [linkedIn-skill-assessment-quizes](https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes) repository.

## To run:
- [Clone repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to wherever you want
- run as a regular [react app in development mode](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)

## Why I did this:
I just wanted some way to turn it into a quiz, opposed to something I read through. It's pretty bare-bones, I only styled it enough to make me not hate it.

## Example of how a question currently looks:

#### A Couple Usability notes:
Currently it's pretty functional, but images are not working for questions, and I've only deeply looked at the exact quizes I'm interested in (Web Development related). Additionally, some questions are submitted in a slightly different syntax occasionally, so that might break questions as well, and I cannot fully control that.

For anything like this, just skip the question. For most text questions, I would expect a 90% or more accuracy in how it's represented.
